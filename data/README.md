# Data used

The datasets used in our project were very large and github does not support them. Links to them can be found here. We will include zip files here. However they need to be unzipped and put in this folder for scipts using them to work. 


For some data sets, we had to restructure the data and we broke it up into smaller chunks. Those are here as well.


## Original datasets sets and links
- [Population data and predictions](https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Standard/CSV/)
- - `All variants` one
- - File name `WPP2017_TotalPopulationBySex.csv`
- - This is a large file in `population_un.zip`


## Created datasets


Note: We only restructured but never added to nor modified the data
